Philosophy of the course will be to enable participants in doing economics. Main software for the course will be R, and STATA with programs will also be provided for many of the topics. This course will\n\nEmphasis on understanding problem solving through real data rather than just simply understanding issues conceptually.\nDeveloping a learning community to improve statistical and econometric skills necessary in the study of economics.\nSome of the resources to be used for this course and freely available are listed as follows:\nMastering metrics: Path from cause to effect\nThe Effect\nImpact Evaluation in Practice",
