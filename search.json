    "text": "Course Overview\nThis training workshop is designed to focus on research design, thinking clearly with data with real life data applications through computer-based exercises and learn to reproduce the econometric results of published economic articles like Card (Nobel Laureate) and Krueger (1994). Philosophy of the course will be to enable participants in doing economics. Main software for the course will be R, and STATA with programs will also be provided for many of the topics. This course will\n\nEmphasis on understanding problem solving techniques, rather than mathematical theorems and complex proofs\nDeveloping a learning community to improve statistical and econometric skills necessary in the study of economics.\nSome of the resources to be used for this course and freely available are listed as follows:\nMastering metrics: Path from cause to effect\nThe Effect\nImpact Evaluation in Practice"
