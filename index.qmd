## Course Overview

This training workshop is designed [ to focus on research design]{.yellow}, [thinking clearly with data]{.yellow} with real life data applications through computer-based exercises and learn to reproduce the econometric results of published economic articles like Card (Nobel Laureate) and Krueger (1994). Philosophy of the course will be to enable participants in [doing economics]{.yellow}. [Main software for the course will be R]{.yellow}, and STATA with programs will also be provided for many of the topics. This course will

-   Emphasis on understanding problem solving through real data rather than just simply understanding issues conceptually.

-   Developing a learning community to improve statistical and econometric skills necessary in the study of economics.
